[Notes]
1. This code-repository is to accompany the symfony tutorial known as "Practical Symfony" (Doctrine version) from the Official Symfony website for Symfony 1 (http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_4/Doctrine/)
2. I am using ubuntu 10.04 LTS desktop, LAMP-Server package (using tasksel) and Symfony 1.4.12 
3. As mentioned in the Day 1 of Practical Symfony, the project is located in /home/sfprojects/jobeet
4. In /etc/hosts added 127.0.0.1 www.jobeet.com.localhost
5. In /etc/apache2/sites-available/, added file name:"www.jobeet.com.localhost"
  file content:
  =====FILE CONTENT=====
  <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.jobeet.com.localhost
    DocumentRoot "/home/sfprojects/jobeet/web"
    DirectoryIndex index.php
    <Directory "/home/sfprojects/jobeet/web">
      AllowOverride All
      Allow from All
    </Directory>

    Alias /sf /home/sfprojects/jobeet/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf
    <Directory "/home/sfprojects/jobeet/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf">
      AllowOverride All
      Allow from All
    </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>
  =====END OF FILE CONTENT=====
  load this site with command 
  $sudo a2ensite www.jobeet.com.localhost
  $sudo service apache2 reload
  You should be able to test the site via browsing http://www.jobeet.com.localhost
6. On Day 8 step "Test Data" remember to add 
  <?php
  require_once dirname(__FILE__).'/../bootstrap/unit.php';
  at the head of file test/unit/model/JobeetJobTest.php


[Trouble Shooting]
  On "Day 8:Unit Tests" You might have something like this
    "You must install and enable xdebug before using lime coverage."
  To install xdebug run "sudo apt-get install php5-xdebug" and add the following code to php.ini usually located in /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
  =====Start of Code to add to php.ini=====
  extension=xdebug.so
  [zend]
  zend_extension="/usr/local/php/modules/xdebug.so"
  =====End of Code to add to php.ini=====
